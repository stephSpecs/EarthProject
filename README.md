# Earth Day Website
## [Think Green, Live Green!](https://stephspecs.github.io/EarthProject/)

This project is a simple website created for my WEB101 course, centered around Earth Day. It includes general information about the event, a list of volunteering opportunities near Miami, and an RSVP form for users who want to participate. The goal of the site is to provide an easy, informative way for visitors to learn more and get involved.
