                <h2>History of Earth Day</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the 1960s, environmental concerns in the United States were beginning to surface more visibly.<br>
                        Widespread air and water pollution, chemical pesticide use, and industrial waste started drawing attention from scientists, educators and the public.<br>
                        The 1962 publication of <em>Silent Spring</em> by Rachel Carson was a key moment, it revealed how humans and wildlife were being affected by long‑term environmental damage.<br>
                        On April 22, 1970, the first Earth Day was held.<br>
                        Spearheaded by U.S. Senator Gaylord Nelson and activist Denis Hayes, it brought together around 20 million Americans in thousands of teach‑ins, rallies and community events to demand action on environmental protection.<br>
                        Following that first Earth Day, profound change happened: by the end of 1970 the U.S. established the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and passed major laws like the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act.<br>
                        These efforts marked the birth of the modern environmental movement.<br>
                        In the decades that followed, Earth Day grew from a national U.S. event into a global one.<br>
                        By 1990 it had been observed in over 140 countries, and today it is celebrated by more than 190 nations with participation exceeding a billion people annually.

                <h2>Significance of Earth Day</h2>
                    <p>
                        Earth Day serves a dual purpose: raising awareness and driving action.<br>
                        On the awareness front, it highlights how environmental health is deeply connected to human health, economic stability and social justice.<br>
                        It reminds us that pollution, habitat loss, climate change and species extinction are not remote issues,they affect our communities and future generations.<br>
                        On the action side, Earth Day has proven to be a catalyst for policy and societal change.<br>
                        The extraordinary turnout of the first Earth Day created political momentum for environmental regulation and institutional reforms.<br>
                        Through grassroots engagement and large scale community participation, the event made it clear that citizens cared—and governments had to respond.<br>
                        Moreover, the global nature of Earth Day elevates it beyond national boundaries.<br>
                        The movement fosters solidarity across countries, cultures and demographics.<br>
                        By involving schools, businesses, non‑profits and everyday citizens worldwide, Earth Day emphasizes that protecting the planet is a shared responsibility.<br>
                        Finally, Earth Day’s importance continues to grow as environmental challenges become more complex.<br>
                        Climate change, biodiversity loss, and plastic pollution are no longer distant threats, they are present realities.<br>
                        Earth Day remains a reminder that consistent, collective action matters now more than ever.

                <h2>Global Events</h2>
                    <p>
                        Earth Day is celebrated annually on April 22, but its reach goes well beyond a single day.<br>
                        Events range from local clean‑ups and tree plantings to global advocacy campaigns, educational programs, and coordinated actions by thousands of organizations.<br>
                        These events enable individuals and communities to engage in meaningful and often measurable environmental activity.<br>
                        Each year, the Earth Day movement selects a theme to focus its efforts, such as reducing plastic waste, advancing renewable energy, restoring ecosystems or engaging youth.<br>
                        These themes help unify diverse global actions under a common goal and allow for large‑scale coordination and impact.<br>
                        Typical event types include beach and park clean‑ups, tree‑plantings, habitat restoration, educational workshops in schools and universities, volunteer drives and advocacy for policy change.<br>
                        Many of these activities link local actions to broader global environmental challenges, allowing people everywhere to participate in the movement.<br>
                        What begins as a local gathering often ties into global networks.<br>
                        Schools might host workshops, companies might launch sustainability pledges and governments may highlight Earth Day in public policy.<br>
                        Together, these create a tapestry of action that spans continents and connects individual efforts to collective change.

                <h2>Fun Facts & Tips</h2>
                    <h4>Facts:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The inaugural Earth Day in 1970 mobilised about 20 million Americans. Roughly 10 % of the U.S. population at that time
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Today, Earth Day is observed in more than 190 countries and engages over one billion people each year.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The date April 22 was chosen because it fell between spring break and final exams for U.S. college students, making it strategically optimal for student participation.

                        </ul>
                    <h4>Tips for Action:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Reduce single-use plastics: switch to reusable bags, bottles, straws and containers to decrease waste and pollution.

                            <li>
                                Plant a tree or support native plant species in your community: this helps improve local biodiversity and climate resilience.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Participate in or organise a clean-up day in your area: beaches, parks, rivers or neighbourhoods are all good places to start.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Educate yourself and others: join a workshop, host a community talk or share knowledge about climate, biodiversity and sustainability.
                            </li>
                            <li>

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Monitor your daily footprint: track energy use, water consumption, waste production and make step-by-step improvements to be more environmentally conscious.
                            </li>

                <h2>Why it Matters</h2>
                    <p>
                        As environmental challenges become more urgent, ranging from global warming and extreme weather to habitat destruction and species extinction. Earth Day matters more than ever.<br>
                        It serves as a yearly checkpoint that reminds us of the stakes and prompts action.<br>
                        What began as a national event has blossomed into a global movement that links personal choices with planetary impact.<br>
                        Moreover, Earth Day isn’t just about awareness,it’s about mobilizing for real change.<br>
                        The fact that it helped influence major legislation and institutional responses underscores its power.<br>
                        It shows that public sentiment, when translated into action, can shift policy and practice.<br>
                        In that sense, Earth Day is both a symbol and a tool: a symbol of our collective responsibility for the planet and a tool for coordinated action locally and globally.<br>
                        By engaging with it each year, we reaffirm that sustainability, conservation and responsibility are part of the future we want and must work for.
